        Enjoy our collection of games!<br>
        We tried to pick little harmless games that serve well entertaining people, while heating their brain up a little bit!<br>
        If you face some difficulty, the 'Undo' button might help! Also we included the link to the Wikipedia pages for anybody who want to know the math!<br>
        Hopefully you learn something afterward as well, and above all, have fun!
